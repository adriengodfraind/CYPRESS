# Data of selected test power systems
This repository contains the data of test power systems that were selected in the context of Task 1.2 of the CYPRESS project.

These data were obtained from a variety of power system test cases repositories and databases. The main ones are the [Texas A&M University’s Electric Grid Test Cases](https://electricgrids.engr.tamu.edu/electric-grid-test-cases/), the [University of Washington’s Power Systems Test Case Archive](https://labs.ece.uw.edu/pstca/), the [Illinois Center for a Smart Electric Grid’s power cases](https://icseg.iti.illinois.edu/power-cases/), the [PyPower library](https://github.com/rwl/PYPOWER/tree/master/pypower), the [Power Grid Lib benchmark library](https://github.com/power-grid-lib/pglib-opf), the [Matpower database](https://github.com/MATPOWER/matpower/tree/master/data) and the [BetterGrids Grid Data Repository](https://db.bettergrids.org/). 

Note that we have collected the files that might be useful, both the original system data files, some of its more popular modifications as well as the versions that were modified as part of the task.
