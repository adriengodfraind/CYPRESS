# Transmission test systems

One of the objectives of Task 1.3 was to design a small set of transmission test systems to be used in the remaining of the project. For this, an exhaustive table summarising test systems available in the literature has been built. The latter is avaible in this repository, along with the set of transmission test systems.

The transmission systems are divided into different groups:
- **Selected systems**  
The systems that satisfied most of the selection criteria. These systems were modified/complemented as needed during the course of the task.

- **Honorary mentions**  
The systems that satisfy a majority of our criteria but that were not modified to satisfy more criteria. Might be modified and used in the future if needed.

- **Large systems**  
Large (more than 100 buses) test systems that will be used towards the end of the project to assess the scalability of the developed methodologies.
